Step 1: "pip install -r req.txt"
This step involves installing the necessary dependencies for the project. The command "pip install" is used to install Python packages and modules from the PyPI repository. The "-r req.txt" flag indicates that the dependencies are listed in a file called "req.txt", and this command will install all the packages listed in that file.

Step 2: "run api.py" don't forgot to change url ADDED'#change with your profile url headers = { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'cookie': '' #take cookie from network api payload headers ,'csrf-token': 'ajax:0313898894319977257'#take csrf from network api payload headers }"
This step involves running the "api.py" file, which likely contains the code for the API itself. The instructions remind you to change the URL and add the appropriate headers to the code before running it. The URL should be changed to your own profile URL, and the headers should include a cookie and a CSRF token, which can be obtained from the network API payload headers.

Step 3: "run main.py"
This step likely involves running a separate Python script called "main.py". It's not clear what this script does, but it may be related to testing or running the API in a specific environment.
